                                <p class="service-summary">Upgrade or install electrical panels to safely handle modern power demands. Enhance safety, reliability, and long-term performance for your electrical systems.</p>

                        <p>An electrical panel, sometimes called a breaker box or service panel, is the central hub that distributes electricity throughout your home or business. Power from your utility company flows into the panel, where it's divided into individual circuits that supply different areas or appliances. Each circuit is protected by a breaker that automatically shuts off power when an overload or fault occurs helping prevent fires and electrical damage.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Main Panel Upgrades or New Installation</h3>
                        <p>A panel upgrade involves replacing your home or business's electrical panel to safely handle modern power demands. Older panels can struggle to support today's appliances, lighting, and technology leading to tripped breakers, flickering lights, or safety hazards. Upgrading your panel is one of the best ways to enhance safety, reliability, and long-term performance for your electrical systems.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Sub Panel Upgrades or New Installation</h3>
                        <p>A sub panel is a smaller electrical panel that extends power from your main service panel to another area of your home or property. It acts as a secondary distribution point, allowing you to add circuits and manage power more efficiently in spaces like garages, workshops, additions, or detached buildings. Sub panels don't create new power, they draw from your main panel, but they make it easier to organize circuits, reduce overloads, and safely expand your electrical system.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Multi-family / Multimeter Panel Installation</h3>
